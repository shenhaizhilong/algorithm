 *889. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal
 * DescriptionHintsSubmissionsDiscussSolution
 * Return any binary tree that matches the given preorder and postorder traversals.
 *
 * Values in the traversals pre and post are distinct positive integers.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: pre = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], post = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
 * Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 1 <= pre.length == post.length <= 30
 * pre[] and post[] are both permutations of 1, 2, ..., pre.length.
 * It is guaranteed an answer exists. If there exists multiple answers, you can return any of them.
